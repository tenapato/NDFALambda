# Documentation
- Function for parsing the given text file:
> buildAutomata(file)
- Method for creating the dictionaries of the automatas with any kind of symbols:
> buildDictionary(Automata)
- Method that recives a set of states, applies lambda closure, and returns a set of states:
> lambdaClosure(states)
- Method that recieves a state, and a char, applies the transition function and retusn a state:
> transitionFunction(state, char)
- Recursive function that receives a state and retrurns a set of strings:
> extendedTransitionFunction(state, string)
